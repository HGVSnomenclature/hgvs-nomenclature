## Proposal Process Overview

- Anyone may submit a proposal for changes to [Discussions](discussions). The proposal is initially considered OPEN and under discussion.
- Anyone may comment on an OPEN proposal.
- The HVNC will evaluate all proposals from time to time. For each proposal, the committee may choose to:
  - leave the proposal OPEN for further discussion;
  - mark the propossal as REJECTED with explanation if the proposal is deemed unworkable, incomplete, or inconsistent with the existing guidelines, or if it is similar to existing or recently considered proposals; or
  - move the propsal to DRAFTING to indicate that a member of the HVNC will understake drafting of the changes.
- When a proposal is in the DRAFTING stage, a GitHub issue is created to track writing for the intended documentation change. Writing will be undertaken in a branch dedicated for the assigned issue. A pull request will eventually be submitted and evaluated.
- Evaluation of the PR is limited to HVNC members (i.e., not for public discussion), although specific users may be asked for comments when warranted. If the PR is eventually merged, the discussion proposal is marked as ADOPTED.
- If the PR is not merged for any reason (e.g., if we realize that the PR creates unforeseen issues with the existing nomenclature), the proposal will either be marked OPEN for more discussion or marked REJECTED at the discretion of the committee.

## A note about our name

We've called the nomenclature by lots of names, including "VarNomen", "MutNomen", "HGVS Recommendations", "HGVS Guidelines", and even just "HGVS" colloquially. We recognize that this has caused confusion in the community. Please refer to our recommendations as the "HGVS Nomenclature".
