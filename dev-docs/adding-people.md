# Adding People to the HGVS Nomenclature Team

This document describes how to add people to the HVNC. You will need to be a
repo administrator to use these instructions.

## HVNC Nomenclature Google Group

The [HVNC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/hvnc)
(hvnc@googlegroups.com) may be used for email, calendar invitations, and Google
Drive permissions.  The advantage of using this group, rather than explicit
email addresses, is that the group ensures that membership is always current.

**The [HVNC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/hvnc), which is private
and exists for HVNC members and key contributors, is disctinct from the [HGVS
Nomenclature Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/hgvs-nomenclature), which
is for public discussion and is open for self-subscription.**

The group is not open, so new users must be added manually by admins.  (As of
this writing, Alex, Ivo, Jeroen, Johan, and Reece are admins.)

## GitHub Repository

### Who needs access?

**Add only users who have a role in the maintainance or administration hgvs-nomenclature.**

hgvs-nomenclature is a public repo. Anyone with a GitHub account may fork the repo, submit pull requests against it, and create or comment on issues and discussions. Public access should be the default mode for most individuals because it's safer and requires no maintainance.

Conversely, anyone who has a privileged role will need to be added invdividually to the repo as described below.  Such users will have one of these roles:

- Triage: Contributors who need to manage issues, discussions, and pull requests without write access
- Write: Contributors who actively push to your project
- Maintain: Project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions
- Admin: People who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository

### Instructions

1. Navigate to https://github.com/HGVSnomenclature/hgvs-nomenclature/settings/access

1. Click Add People
