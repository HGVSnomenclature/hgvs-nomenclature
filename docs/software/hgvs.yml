description: |
  The *hgvs* package provides a Python library to parse, format, validate,
  normalize, and map sequence variants according to [Variation
  Nomenclature](http://varnomen.hgvs.org/) (aka Human Genome Variation
  Society) recommendations.

  Specifically, the hgvs package focuses on the subset of the HGVS
  recommendations that precisely describe sequence-level variation
  relevant to the application of high-throughput sequencing to clinical
  diagnostics. The package does not attempt to cover the full scope of
  HGVS recommendations.
