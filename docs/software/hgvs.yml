  The *hgvs* package provides a Python library to parse, format, validate,
  normalize, and map sequence variants according to [HGVS
  Nomenclature](http://hgvs-nomenclature.org/).

  The hgvs package focuses on the subset of the HGVS recommendations that
  precisely describe sequence-level variation relevant to the application of
  high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostics. The hgvs package does not
  attempt to cover the full scope of HGVS recommendations.  A key feature of the
  hgvs package is the ability to correctly project variants in the presence of
  genome-transcript alignment indels (see
  [PubMed:30129167](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30129167/)).
