description: |
  The LOVD HGVS syntax checker parses and validates DNA variant descriptions on
  the syntax level, not the nucleotide level like other validators. While this
  obviously means that sequence-level validation is still necessary, this
  library can support variant types not supported by sequence-level validators.
  
  Examples of variant types supported by the LOVD HGVS syntax checker that are
  normally not supported by sequence-level validators are variants without
  reference sequences, variants with unknown boundaries, variants with partially
  unknown sequences, mosaicism and chimerism, and epigenetic changes.

  Furthermore, the software has been developed to recognize dozens of common
  mistakes in HGVS descriptions and changes caused by formatting in journals.
  In most cases, the software is able to automatically correct these. Only when
  the solution is not immediately obvious, will the software leave the choice to
  the user, giving informative warnings to explain which options the user can
  choose from to correct their description.
