  VariantValidator is a user-friendly software tool designed to validate the
  syntax and parameters of DNA variant descriptions according to the HGVS
  Sequence Variant Nomenclature.

  VariantValidator ensures that users are guided through the intricacies of the
  HGVS nomenclature, e.g. if the user makes a mistake, VariantValidator
  automatically corrects the mistake if it can, or provides helpful guidance if
  it cannot. In addition, VariantValidator accurately inter-converts between
  transcript variant descriptions and genomic variant descriptions in HGVS and
  Variant Call Format (VCF)

  VariantValidator interfaces with the hgvs package to parse, format, and
  manipulate biological sequence variants. See
  https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/ for details of the hgvs package

  VariantValidator is a highly functional platform enabling high-throughput and
  embeddable utilisation of functionality of https://variantvalidator.org/
