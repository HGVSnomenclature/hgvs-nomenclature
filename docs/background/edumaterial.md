# Educational Material

A detailed explanation of HGVS nomenclature can be found on this website.
Summaries, using different formats, have been published in journals and several book chapters (see [History](history.md)).

- **Basics**<br>
  the basics of the current recommendations are explained in a [slide presentation](http://www.hgvs.org/varnomen/HGVS-basics2017.pdf) from **Johan den Dunnen** (last updated Apr.2017).

- **Facebook**<br>
  topics of interest are regularly discussed on the [HGVS nomenclature facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HGVSmutnomen).
  The HGVS nomenclature facebook agenda can be used to see where the recommendations are presented/discussed.

- **Online sessions**<br>
  In June 2021, we started a series of online HGVS nomenclature Q&A sessions.
  The meetings will be bi-monthly, on the 4th Tuesday of every 2nd month (even months).
  The time of the meeting will be alternated to allow people from either Asia+Australia, Europe+Africa, or North+South America to participate during the day.
  For questions to be answered we use the [DirectPoll](https://www.DirectPoll.com) online polling system.
  The idea is for you to train yourself and learn HGVS nomenclature by applying the recommendations.
  For those not able to participate, the questions will be available using a [Socrative](https://www.Socrative.com) classroom (see below).
  Each event will be listed on the [Human Genome Organisation's (HUGO) Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/humangenomeorg).

- **Test your knowledge**<br>
  testing your knowledge of the current recommendations can be done using **Question & Answer** tests we make available through the [Socrative platform](http://www.socrative.com).
  To try, either download the [Socrative Student App](https://www.socrative.com/apps/) or use the Socrative website and [Login as a Student](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/).
  When asked, go to a **specific classroom** and give it a try.
