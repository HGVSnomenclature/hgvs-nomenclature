The HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC) is authorised by the [Human Genome Organisation (HUGO)](https://www.hugo-international.org), a working group of the [HUGO Nomenclature Standards Committee](https://www.hugo-international.org/standards), with administrative support of the HUGO office.
Activities of the HVNC follow the committee's Terms of Reference with new members being appointed every two years for a four-year term.
HVNC members should together represent all interested communities, including gene/disease specific database curators, central repositories, clinical geneticists, commercial diagnostic laboratories, bioinformaticians, scientific journals, etc.
The HVNC is the successor of the HGVS nomenclature Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG), initiated by the [Human Variome Project](https://www.humanvariomeproject.org/sdp/wg04-sequence-variant-description-committee.html).

## Mission

The mission of the HVNC is to define the standard for the unambiguous description of all sequence variants on the DNA, RNA, and protein level: the HGVS nomenclature.

## HVNC members

The HVNC started in 2013, initiated by Global Variome (GV) / the Human Variome Project (HVP).
