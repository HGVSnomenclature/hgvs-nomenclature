The HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC) is authorised by the [Human Genome Organisation (HUGO)](https://www.hugo-international.org), a working group of the [HUGO Nomenclature Standards Committee](https://www.hugo-international.org/standards), with administrative support of the HUGO office. Activities of the HVNC follow the committee's Terms of Reference with new members being appointed every two years for a four-year term. HVNC members should together represent all interested communities, including gene/disease specific database curators, central repositories, clinical geneticists, commercial diagnostic laboratories, bioinformaticians, scientific journals, etc. The HVNC is the successor of the HGVS nomenclature Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG), initiated by the [Human Variome Project](https://www.humanvariomeproject.org/sdp/wg04-sequence-variant-description-committee.html).

## Misson

The mission of the HVNC is to define the standard for the unambiguous description of all sequence variants at the DNA, RNA and protein level, the so called HGVS nomenclature standard.

## HVNC members

The HVNC started in 2013, initiated by Global Variome (GV) / the Human Variome Project (HVP).
