*	p.His4_Gln5insAla
	:	the insertion of amino acid <font color="red">Ala</font> between amino acids His4 and Gln5 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLysGlyHis**<font color="red">Ala</font>**GlnGlnCys
*	p.Lys2_Gly3insGlnSerLys
	:	the insertion of amino acids <font color="red">GlnSerLys</font> between amino acids Lys2 and Gly3 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLys**<font color="red">GlnSerLys</font>**GlyHisGlnGlnCys
*	p.(Met3_His4insGlyTer)
	:	the predicted consequence at the protein level of an insertion at the DNA level (c.9_10insGGGTAG) is the insertion of GlyTer (alternatively Gly\*)
	:	**NOTE**: this is not described as p.(Met3_Ile3418delinsGly), a deletion-insertion replacing the entire C-terminal protein coding sequence downstream of Met3 with a Gly)
*	NP_004371.2:p.(Pro46_Asn47insSerSerTer)
	:	the predicted consequence at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_004380.2:c.138_139insTCATCATGAGCTCCC is te insertion of "SerSerTer" between amino acids Pro46 and Asn47 (alternatively SerSer\*).
	:	**NOTE:** the insertion is not described as "insSerSerTerAlaPro", amino acids after the translation termination codon are not listed
*   p.Arg78_Gly79insX[23]
	:	the in-frame insertion of a 23 amino acid sequence between amino acids Arg78 and Gly79
	:	**NOTE:** it must be possible to deduce the 23 inserted amino acids from the description given at DNA or RNA level
*   NP_060250.2:p.Gln746_Lys747ins\*63
	:	the in-frame insertion of a 62 amino acid sequence ending at a stop codon at position \*63 between amino acids Gln746 and Lys747
	:	**NOTE:** it must be possible to deduce the inserted amino acid sequence from the description given at DNA or RNA level
*	incomplete descriptions (preferably use exact descriptions only)
	*	NP_003997.1:p.(Ser332_Ser333insX[1])
	:	the insertion of an unknown amino acid ('insX[1]') between amino acids Ser332 and Ser333
	:	**NOTE**: the IUPAC code for an unknown amino acid is 'X' ([_see Standards_](/background/standards/)). Note that in the past 'X' has been used to indicate a translation termination codon.
	*	NP_003997.1:p.(Val582_Asn583insX[5]) (alternatively NP_003997.1:p.(Val582_Asn583insXXXXX))
	:       the insertion of 5 unknown amino acids (insX[5]) between amino acids Val582 and Asn583
