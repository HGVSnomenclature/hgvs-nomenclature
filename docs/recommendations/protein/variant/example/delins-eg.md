*	p.Cys28delinsTrpVal
	:	a deletion of amino acid Cys28, replaced with TrpVal
*	p.Cys28_Lys29delinsTrp
	:	a deletion of amino acids Cys28 and Ly29, replaced with Trp
*	NP_004371.2:p.(Asn47delinsSerSerTer)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_004380.2:c.139delinsTCATCATGAGCTG is a deletion of amino acid Asn47  replaced with SerSerTer (alternatively SerSer\*).
	:	**NOTE**: the deletion-insertion is not described as "delinsSerSerTerAlaAsp", amino acids after the translation termination codon are **not** listed.
*	p.(Pro578_Lys579delinsLeuTer)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_080877.2c.1733_1735delinsTTT is a deletion of amino acids Pro578 and Lys579 replaced with LeuTer (alternatively Leu\*)
	:	**NOTE**: the predicted consequence of variant NM_080877.2:c.1732_1794del is p.(Pro578_Gln598del). Although the proteins resulting from the changes NM_080877.2:c.1733_1735delinsTTT and c.1732_1794del are identical, their HGVS description is different. **NOTE**: example derives from the SLC34A3 gene.
*	NP_000213.1:p.(Val559_Glu561del)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_000222.3:c.1676_1684del. The variant is **not** described as p.(Val559_Glu562delinsGlu), where Glu562 would be replaced by a Glu which effectively is no change. Example derives from the KIT gene.
*	NP_003070.3:p.(Glu125_Ala132delinsGlyLeuHisArgPheIleValLeu)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_003079.4:c.374_395inv is a deletion of amino acids Glu125 to Ala132 replaced with GlyLeuHisArgPheIleValLeu.
	:	**NOTE**: the predicticted consequence from the inversion on DNA level is described as a deletion-insertion (inversions are not used at protein level)
*	p.[Ser44Arg;Trp46Arg]
	:	the change of two variants affecting amino acids separated by another amino acid.
	:	**NOTE**: the variant is not described as p.Ser44_Trp46delinsArgLeuArg
