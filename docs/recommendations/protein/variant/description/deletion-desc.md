### Note

*	all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and protein level may be given in addition
*	**prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein).
*	predicted consequences, i.e. without experimental evidence (no RNA or protein sequence analysed), should be given in parentheses, e.g. p.(Arg727_Ser783del).
*	the "amino_acids+positions_deleted" should contain **two different** positions, i.e. Cys76_Glu79, not Cys76_Cys76.
	*	the "positions_deleted" should be listed from **5' to 3'**, i.e. Cys76_Glu79, not Glu79_Cys76.
*	for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**).
*	in theory, a **nonsense** variant can be considered as a deletion removing the C-terminal end of the protein (e.g. p.Trp26_Arg1623del). By definition, nonsense variants are described as an amino acid substitution (p.Trp26Ter or p.Trp26* [_see Substitution_](/recommendations/protein/variant/substitution)) replacing the first amino acid affected by a translation termination (stop) codon.
*	variants extending the amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end with one or more amino acids, are described as [_Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension).
*	deletions at the DNA or RNA level
	*	which introduce an **immediate** translation termination (stop) codon are described as nonsense variant.
	*	**starting N-terminal of and including** the translation termination (stop) codon are described as [_Frame shift_](/recommendations/protein/variant/frameshift).
