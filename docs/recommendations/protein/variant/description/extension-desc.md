### Note

* all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
* **prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein).
* **extension** variants have been accepted on <font color="red">2012-08-31</font>.
* **predicted consequences**, i.e. without experimental evidence (no RNA or protein sequence analysed), should be given in parentheses, e.g. p.(Ter110GlnextTer17) or p.(\*110Glnext\*17).
* variants affecting the translation initiation site (Met1) activating an upstream (N-terminal) translation initiation site are described as [_deletion-insertion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/delins/), those activating a downstream (C-terminal)  initiation site as a [_deletion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/).
* **prioritisation**: (1) extension, (2) frame shift or deletion-insertion.
