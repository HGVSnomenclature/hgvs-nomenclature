# repeated sequences

## Definition

Repeated sequence: a sequence where, compared to a reference sequence, a segment of **one or more** amino acids (the repeat unit) is present several times, one after the other..

## Description

Format:   **"prefix""amino_acid(s)+position_repeat_unit""[""copy_number""]"**,  e.g. p.(Arg65_Ser67[12])

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  p.
**"amino_acid(s)+position_repeat_unit"**  =  amino acids position (range) first repeat copy  =  Arg65\_Ser67
**[**  =  opening symbol for allele  =  [
**"copy_number"**  =  number of repeat units  =  12
**]**  =  closing symbol for allele  =  ]

## Notes

* all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
* **prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein).
* repeated sequences include both small (mono-, di-, tri-, etc., amino acid) and larger repeats.
## Examples

* p.Ala2[10]: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Ala-residue located at position 2 is present in 10 copies.: **NOTE**: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 10 units, the description p.Ala2[9] is preferred over p.Ala11del.: **NOTE**: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 10 units, the description p.Ala2[12] is preferred over p.Ala10\_Ala11dup.
* p.Ala2[10];[11]: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Ala-residue located at position 2, is present in 10 copies on one allele and 11 copies on the other allele.
* p.Gln18[23]: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Gln-residue located at position 18 is present in 23 copies (HD Gln-repeat based on the HTT (huntingtin) protein reference sequence (GenBank NP\_002102.4)): **NOTE**: the protein reference sequence (GenBank NP\_002102.4) contains an allele of 23 Gln copies (encoded by 22 "cag" and 1 "caa" codons).
    * p.(Gln18)[(70\_80)]: the predicted Gln amnio acid repeat, starting at position 18, has an estimated size of between 70 to 80 copiess.: **NOTE**: the repeat can encoded by a mix of different coding triplets ("cag", "caa").
