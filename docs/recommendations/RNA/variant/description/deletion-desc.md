### Note

* all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
* **prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
* the "position(s)\_deleted" should contain **two different positions**, e.g. 123\_126 but not 123\_123.
* the "position(s)\_deleted" should be listed from **5' to 3'**, e.g. 123\_126 but not 126\_123.
* for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
    * the 3'rule also applies for changes in single residue stretches and tandem repeats  (nucleotide or amino acid): **NOTE:** the exception to the 3'rule for deletions around exon/exon junctions  [_see Deletions_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/deletion/) does not apply when describing variants based on a RNA reference sequence
* <sup>1</sup> = [_see Uncertain_](/recommendations/uncertain/); when the postion and/or the sequence of a deletion has not been defined, a description may have a format like r.(100_150)del(15)
