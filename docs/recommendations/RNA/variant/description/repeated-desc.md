### Note

*	all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
*	reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
*	repeated sequences include both small (mono-, di-, tri-, etc., nucleotide) and larger (kilobase-sized) repeats. 
*	the format based on **repeat position** is preferred, descriptions of the repeat sequence quickly become too lengthy.
	*	**NOTE**: while r.123cug[23] describes a repeat of 23 "cug" units, r.123_125[23] describes a tri-nucleotide repeat of 23 units which **could be interrupted** with other units (e.g. a rare "cua"). The description r.123cug[23] can thus only be used when the repeat was sequenced.
*	the format r.-125\_-123cug[4], should not be used; it contains redundant information ("-125\_-123" and "cug"). 
*	for **composite repeats** the basic format can be used, successively listing each different repeat unit; r.456_465[4]466_489[9]490_499[3].
