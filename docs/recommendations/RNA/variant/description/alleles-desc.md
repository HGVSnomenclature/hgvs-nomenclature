### Note

* all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
* humans are diploid organisms and have **two alleles** at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent
* when two variants are identified in a transcript that derive from **one chromosome** (in cis) this should be described as "r.[variant1**<font color="red">;</font>**variant2]".
* when two variants are identified in transcripts that derive from **different chromosomes** (in trans) this should be described as "r.[variant1]**<font color="red">;</font>**[variant2]".
* when two variants are identified in a transcript, but when it is **not known** whether these derive from one chromosome (in cis) or from different chromosomes (in trans), this should be described as "**variant1<font color="red">(;)</font>variant2**", i.e. without using "[ ]".  **NOTE:** it is recommended to determine whether the changes are in the same transcript or not.
* when two variants are identified in two different transcripts that derive from **one variant** at the DNA level the variants are separated using a “,”; p.[variant1**<font color="red">,</font>**variant2]”.
