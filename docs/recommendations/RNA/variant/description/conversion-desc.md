### Note

* all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
* **prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA)
* the region converted ("positions\_converted") should **start** and **end** with a variant nucleotide
* for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
    * the 3'rule applies to ALL descriptions (genome, gene, transcript and protein) of a given variant
