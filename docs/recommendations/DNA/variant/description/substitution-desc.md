### Note

* **prefix** reference sequences accepted are g., m., c. and n. (genomic, mitochondrial, coding DNA and non-coding DNA).
* substitutions involving two or more consecutive nucleotides are described as deletion/insertion (delins) variants ([_see Deletion/insertion (delins)_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/delins/)).
* two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should be described individually and not as a “delins” of the sequence affected
    * exception: two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a “delins”: **NOTE:** this prevents tools predicting the consequences of a variant to make conflicting and incorrect predictions (e.g. c.235\_237delinsTAT (p.Lys79Tyr) versus c.[235A>T;237G>T] (p.[Lys79*;Lys79Asn]): ****NOTE:**** the SVD-WG has prepared a proposal to modify this recommendation ([_see SVD-WG010_](/background/consultation/SVD-WG010/)). The new proposal is: **two variants that are separated by two or fewer intervening nucleotides (that is, not including the variants themselves) should be described as a single “delins” variant**
* nucleotides that have been tested and found **not changed** are described as c.123=, g.4567_4569= ([_see SVD-WG001 (no change)_](/background/consultation/SVD-WG001/)).
* it is not correct to describe "_polymorphisms_" as c.76A/G ([_see Discussions_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/#polymorphism)).
