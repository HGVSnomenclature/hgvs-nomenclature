### Note

*	****NOTE:**** based on [_proposal SVD-WG009_](/background/consultation/SVD-WG009/) the variant type "con" for conversion is no longer used. Conversion variants should be described as "delins" (deletion-insertion).
*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are g., m., c. and n. (genomic, mitochondrial, coding DNA and non-coding DNA)
*	the region converted ("positions\_converted") should **start** and **end** with a variant nucleotide
*	for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
	*	the 3'rule applies to ALL descriptions (genome, gene, transcript and protein) of a given variant
