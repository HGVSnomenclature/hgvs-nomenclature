### Note

*	reference sequences accepted are g., o. m., c. and n. (genomic, mitochondrial, coding DNA and non-coding DNA)
*	for **mixed repeats** the range of the reapeat sequence is given followed by a listing of each repeat unit and the number of repeats in each unit; NC_000012.11:g.112036755_112036823CTG[9]TTG[1]CTG[13].
*	NM_000044.3:c.171GCA[23] describes a repeated sequence containing 23 GCA units (sequenced). NM_000044.3:c.(92_331)insN[33] describes an insertion of 3 nucleotides, in the amplified region from position c.92 to c.331 (**not sequenced**), of a repeated sequence containing 24 GCA units.
*	**exception:** using a coding DNA reference sequence ("c." description) a Repeated sequence variant description can be used only for repeat units with a length which is a multiple of 3, i.e. which can not affect the reading frame. Consequently, use NM_024312.4:c.2692_2693dup and **not** NM_024312.4:c.2686A[10], use NM_024312.4:c.1741_1742insTATATATA and **not** NM_024312.4:c.1738TA[6].
