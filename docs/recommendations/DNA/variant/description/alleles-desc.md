### Note

*	humans are diploid organisms and have **two alleles** at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent
*	when two variants are identified in a gene that are on **one chromosome** (in cis) this should be described as "g.[variant1**<font color="red">;</font>**variant2]".
*	when two variants are identified in a gene that are **on different chromosomes** (in trans) this should be described as "g.[variant1]**<font color="red">;</font>**[variant2]".
*	using allele descriptions involving two or more different variants you do not indicate the other allele does not contain the variant (unless one allele contains no variants at all). LRG\_199t1:c.[2376G>C];[3103del] is correct, LRG\_199t1:c.[2376G>C;3103=];[2376=;3103del] is not correct.
* when two variants are identified in a gene, but when it is **not known** whether these are on one chromosome (in cis) or on different chromosomes (in trans), this should be described as "**variant1<font color="red">(;)</font>variant2**", i.e. without using "[ ]".<br>
**NOTE:** in the latest publication of the recommendations ([Den Dunnen et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22981/pdf)) the example given is not correct.<br>
**NOTE:** it is recommended to determine whether the changes are on the same chromosome or not.
*	descriptions combining variants based on different reference sequence types (e.g. **<font color="red">c.</font>**[76A>C];**<font color="red">g.</font>**[10091C>G]) should not be used.
