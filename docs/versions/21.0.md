!!! note "We need your help"

    Version 21.0.0 is the first significant update in HGVS Nomenclature in almost four years.
    While we have resolved many errors during this work, it is possible that new errors were introduced. If you find an issue, please [contact us](/#contact-us).

## 21.0.0 (ETA 2024-01-08)

### Major Changes

- **Clarification of our name** The preferred name is now "HGVS Nomenclature". The many previous names (e.g., HGVS guidelines, HGVS recommendations, VarNomen, Mutnomen) created confusion and are obsolete.
- **URL change** To foster stable URLs and better serve the community, HGVS Nomenclature now has a dedicated domain name, [hgvs-nomenclature.org](hgvs-nomenclature.org). The previous pages are now archived at [archive.hgvs-nomenclature.org](https://archive.hgvs-nomenclature.org/). The old site, [varnomen.hgvs.org](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/) forwards users to the corresponding page on the new site.
- **New organization** HGVS Nomenclature is overseen by the [Human Variant Nomenclature Committee](/hvnc/), under the aegis of the [Human Genome Organization (HUGO)](https://www.hugo-international.org/). Thank you to the [Human Genome Variation Society](https://hgvs.org/) and the Human Variome Project (https://www.humanvariomeproject.org/) for earlier support.
- **Website Modernization** Previously The intention during migration was to retain the text and the intention of the original text, while modernizing the management of HGVS Nomenclature.
- **Switch to semantic versioning** Beginning with 21, historical versions will also be available
- **Introduction of grammar-like syntax**.
- **Modernized mechanism to contact the HVNC** facebook blah,

    While the recommendations themselves are mostly unchanged, this release nonetheless includes a very large number of changes that will enable the standard to evolve more easily and better serve the needs of the community.
