# HGVS Nomenclature

!!! important
    This is a development and preview site for updates to the HGVS Recommendations.  Please see [the website migration discussion](https://github.com/HGVSnomenclature/HVNC/discussions/17) for a description of the proposed changes and current progress.

The **HGVS Nomenclature** is an internationally-recognized standard for the description of
DNA, RNA and protein sequence variants. It is used to share information about variants and for
clinical reporting.

The HGVS Nomenclature is administered by the [HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC)](hvnc.md)
under the auspices of the [Human Genome Organization (HUGO)](https://hugo-int.org/).

## News

Proposal [SVD-WG010 (var distance)](../consultation/SVD-WG010/) is now <span class="spotlight">closed</span>, SVD-WG decision pending.
An overview of recent additions, especially those that led to a change of the **HGVS version number**, can be found on the [Versioning page](../background/versioning).
The [HGVS nomenclature facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HGVSmutnomen) regularly posts topics of interest, including **Q&A's** and a nomenclature agenda.

## A note about our name

We've called ourselves by lots of names, including "VarNomen", "MutNomen", "HGVS Recommendations", "HGVS Guidelines", and even just "HGVS" colloquially.  We recognize that this has caused confusion in the community.  Please call us "HGVS Nomenclature".
