The **HGVS Nomenclature** is an internationally-recognized standard for the description of DNA, RNA, and protein sequence variants.
It is used to convey variants in clinical reports and to share variants in publications and databases.

The HGVS Nomenclature is administered by the [HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC)](hvnc.md) under the auspices of the [Human Genome Organization (HUGO)](https://hugo-int.org/).

## A note about our name

We've called ourselves by lots of names, including "VarNomen", "MutNomen", "HGVS Recommendations", "HGVS Guidelines", and even just "HGVS" colloquially.
We recognize that this has caused confusion in the community.
Please call us "HGVS Nomenclature".
