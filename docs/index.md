    This is a development and preview site for updates to the HGVS Recommendations.  Please see [the website migration discussion](https://github.com/HGVSnomenclature/HVNC/discussions/17) for a description of the proposed changes and current progress.

The <b>HGVS Nomenclature</b> is an internationally-recognized standard for the description of
DNA, RNA and protein sequence variants. It is used to share information about variants and for
clinical reporting.

The HGVS Nomenclature is administered by the [HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC)](hvnc.md)
under the auspices of the [Human Genome Organization (HUGO)](https://hugo-int.org/).
