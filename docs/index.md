The **HGVS Nomenclature** is an internationally-recognized standard for the description of DNA, RNA, and protein sequence variants.
It is used to convey variants in clinical reports and to share variants in publications and databases.

The HGVS Nomenclature is administered by the [HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC)](hvnc.md) under the auspices of the [Human Genome Organization (HUGO)](https://hugo-int.org/).

## Contact Us

Users of HGVS Nomenclature are invited to contact us to ask questions or get involved with its development.

### Ask questions

Join the [HGVS Nomenclature](https://groups.google.com/g/hgvs-nomenclature)
group and mailing list. This is the preferred forum for discussing questions
and issues regarding the HGVS Nomenclature, and for receiving announcements
about new releases.

Messages sent to
[hgvs-nomenclature@googlegroups.com](mailto:hgvs-nomenclature@googlegroups.com)
will be distributed to members by email. You do not need to be a member to send
a message to the group. **However, you will not see a reply unless you join the
group or manually check the [HGVS Nomenclature](https://groups.google.com/g/hgvs-nomenclature)
conversation archive**.

When members of the community reach out to the HGVS nomenclature committee with
questions via the google group email, we aim to respond within 2 business days
of email receipt. If you havenâ€™t received a response within four business days,
please post a reminder under your question in the google group. For a more
expedited response in relation to a clinical case, please indicate this in both
the subject line and body of the email inquiry. We cannot guarantee that even
clinical inquiries will be addressed outside of business hours or on weekends.

You may also submit questions to our
[GitHub repository Q&A board](<https://github.com/HGVSnomenclature/hgvs-nomenclature/discussions/new?category=q-a>).

### Submit HGVS revision proposals

## A note about our name

We've called ourselves by lots of names, including "VarNomen", "MutNomen", "HGVS
Recommendations", "HGVS Guidelines", and even just "HGVS" colloquially. We
recognize that this has caused confusion in the community. Please call the
specification "HGVS Nomenclature".
